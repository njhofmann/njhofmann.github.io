After a few grueling and unpleasant months of completing countless numbers of applications, wasting hours on numerous Leetcode challenges, and a few failed interviews - I am fortunate enough to have accepted a software engineering internship with Red Ventures for the upcoming summer. However looking back over that time, I have some obvious and not-so-obvious thoughts from my own experience - and the antecdotes of others - I would like to write a bit about.

## Hiring is More Compeitive than Ever

This fall has been by far the most competitive year I have seen for internship & new grad hiring out of the 3.5 years I have been in schools. The trend of ever increasing numbers of computer science majors has [continued this year](), with the additional wallop of a global pandemic to [cut jobs and hiring]() ontop. 

So with fewer positions and more applicants, seeing hundreds if not thousands of applicants applying even for small companies with less name-recognition on the likes of LinkedIn has become the new norm. From this, tales of students applying to hundreds of positions, with few receiving callbacks and even fewer even receiving offers have sprung up. 

Personally, I applied to ~150-200 positions, received ~15-20 callbacks, and received one offer. This is from someone with two previous co-ops nearing their final year of .

Given how the panedmic plays out into 2021 - I think it is very reasonable to see these same trends continue if not worsen.

## We Still Have It Pretty Good

At the end of it all, I think it is worth pointing out that CS majors still have things pretty good. Even in the midst of a pandemic - hiring is overall still pretty strong, tech organizations have transitioned to remote work settings easier than most, and CS graduates still command some of the highest new graduate & internship salaries out of any field.
