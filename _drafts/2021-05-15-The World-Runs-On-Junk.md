<!-- Thesis: things run on junk, this is inefficient but probably necessary?-->

Many of the things modern society requires to function are possible only because of massive amounts of junk processed by those systems.

When you break down the revenue of the firms behind many of these enterprises, you see much of it is junk. We order things we throw away, we receive mail we instantly toss, we see ads we didn't ask for promoting things we don't want to buy, etc.

<!-- international shipping, emails, advertisements -->

## Internet Advertisements

The internet runs on advertising. Unless you're using an ad-blocker; when trying to read an article, watch a video, or perform an internet search - one will almost certainly have ads forced across their periphery. 

They gunk up margins and headers, prolong watch times, and sit atop search results constantly distracting users from their original purpose. They are almost always a net negative to user experience (reference here), yet - at least with how things are structured - are needed for the internet to run.

## International Shipping

Global shipping runs on the back massive container ships that are always circumnavigating the globe carrying all the wonderful delights of modern society from iPhones to the latest fashion. 

## Mail

In the same vein as global shipping, most pieces of mail shipped across the US is pure garbage. Gone are the days of letters from friends or college acceptance letters, now when you yank open your mailbox and you're just met with heaps of advertisments. At best you might have a utility bill from your utility company that hasn't caught the 

Something like ___% of all mail shipped in the US junk mail, funding a hefty percentage of the USPS's services. This creates a wonderful perverse inventive where such companies may seek to increase their intake of junk mail to pad their bottom lines.

# Bottom Line

It personally sickens me a little thinking of all the resources put towards making all this junk and delivering it, all for it just to end up in the trash as soon as its received. 

Yet as things stand now, all this junk is how many things we do enjoy are produced. Most websites wouldn't be around without ads, the few items you actually do keep after ordering might not be in your hands, and the pace at which things are shipped to your house might be a lot slower if your mailbox wasn't always stuffed with ads.

So is junk is a necessary evil to keep things running along, or do we just have bad systems that we haven't replaced due to the sheer weight of their societal momentum?
