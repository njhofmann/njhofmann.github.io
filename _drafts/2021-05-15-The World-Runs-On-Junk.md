<!-- Thesis: things run on junk, this is inefficient but probably necessary?-->

Many of the things modern society requires to function are possible only because of massive amounts of junk processed by those systems.

When you break down the revenue of the firms behind many of these enterprises, you see much of it is junk. We order things we throw away, we receive mail instantly toss, we see ads we didn't ask for, etc.

<!-- international shipping, emails, advertisements -->

## Internet Advertisements

The internet runs on advertising. Unless you're using an ad-blocker; when trying to read an article, watch a video, or perform an internet search - one will almost certainly have ads forced across their periphery. 

They gunk up margins and headers, prolong watch times, and sit atop search results constantly distracting users from their original purpose. They are almost always a net negative to user experience (reference here), yet they are needed for the internet to run. 

[stats here] Alphabet (Google's parent corp) makes ... from Google and ... from YouTube, social media giants like Facebook make ...,

## International Shipping

Global shipping runs on the back massive 

## Mail

In the same vein as global shipping, most pieces of mail shipped across the US is pure garbage. Gone are the days of letters from friends or college acceptance letters, now open your mailbox and you'll just see heaps of advertisments. At best you'll have a bill from your utilites company if you haven't gone paperless.

Something like ___% of all mail shipped in the US junk mail, funding a hefty percentage of the USPS's services. This creates a wonderful perverse inventive where such companies may seek to increase their intake of junk mail to pad their bottom lines.

# Bottom Line

It is a little sickening to think of all the resources wasted making all this junk, delivering it, all for it just to end up in a landfill or recycling bin shortly after. Yet as things stand now, all this junk is how many things we do enjoy are produced. Most websites wouldn't be around without ads, the few items you actually do keep after ordering might not be in your hands, and the pace at which things are shipped to your house might be a lot slower if your mailbox wasn't always stuffed with ads.

So is junk is a necessary evil to keep things running along, or our systems failing if they allow such things to happen in the first place?
