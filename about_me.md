# {{ page.title }}

I am Nate Hofmann, I am currently a fifth year undergraduate at Northeastern University studying computer science. A majority of my academic & work interests lie in the realms of building intelligent systems (machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc.), programming languages, and mathematics. On the side I spend time long distance running, weight lifting, reading, drawing, writing, or playing *Magic: The Gathering*!

My resume is available on request!
