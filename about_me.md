# {{ page.title }}

My name is Nate Hofmann, I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at Northeastern University studying Computer Science. Most of my academic / work interests lie in the realms of building intelligent systems (machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc.), programming languages, and mathematics. On the side, most of time is spent long distance running, reading, or immersed in a strategy game!

My resume is available on request!
