# {{ page.title }}

I am Nate Hofmann, I am an (incoming) software engineer at Microsoft, working on the Data Integration team with the Azure AI platform. I received my bachelor's from at Northeastern University studying computer science, with an emphasis on artificial intelligence research. A majority of my academic & work interests lie in the realms of building intelligent systems (machine learning, evolutionary algorithms, etc.), programming languages, and mathematics. On the side I spend time drawing, writing, hiking, or playing *Magic: The Gathering*!

My resume is available on request!
