All of my personal work can be found under my [Github repo](https://github.com/njhofmann). Listed below is a sampling of the work I am the most proud of.

### [arXivist](https://github.com/njhofmann/arXivist)
* A Python command line interface for retreiving, storing, tagging, etc. research papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and other pre-print sites
* Built with Python, Postgres, and Docker.

### [portolve](https://github.com/njhofmann/portolve)
* An exploration of solving the [optimal portfolio problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization) through various evolutionary algorithmic techniques. 
* Build with Kotlin and Gradle.

### [mtg-analysis](https://github.com/njhofmann/mtg-analysis)
* Time series analysis and modeling of competitive level metagames and card prices for the trading card game *Magic: The Gathering*.
* Built with Python's SciPy computing environment (Pandas, Numpy, etc.) and Postgres.

### [racket-csp](https://github.com/njhofmann/racket-csp)
* A generalized constraint satisfaction solver written in Racket. 

### [color-mess](https://github.com/njhofmann/color-mess)
* Collection of various utility classes and functions for basic image manipulation and generation.
* Built on top of Python and Pillow (Python Imaging Library fork).

## Older Projects
Some *very* old projects that are in desperate need of getting an update or rewrite, but are still interesting enough to mention.

### [advanced-seams](https://github.com/njhofmann/advanced-seams)
* Implementation of various [seam carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving) techniques for content-aware image resizing.
* Originally written only in Java with stand-alone libraries. Needs to be integrated into a proper build tool like Gradle and made into a useable utility.

### [ManaFlood](https://github.com/njhofmann/ManaFlood)
* Intended to be a desktop GUI & CLI for deck building and card querying for *Magic: The Gathering*, but overshot the scope of the project.
* Originally written in Java & SQLite, needs to be integrated with a proper build tool and more powerful database like Postgres. As well scaling back to only a CLI tool.
